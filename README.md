# LetterGame
My course work. It's the small android game for children with OOP and LibGDX framework. Player needs to combine words from letters. Game have a three levels with different subjects: Trees, Animals and Colors. Each of them contains some words, which separating on letters and taking place on game field randomly. Player can move letters by drag-n-drop to combine them in a full word.

Architecture of the application allow add new levels and words without changing the code.
